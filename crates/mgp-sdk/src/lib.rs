//! Pure-logic SDK for MGP connectors.
//!
//! `mgp-sdk` provides the shared logic that ClotoHub.dev's catalog
//! sync worker and ClotoCore's install path both need to handle a
//! `cloto-connector.json` manifest:
//!
//! - [`types`] — Rust definitions for the v1 manifest schema.
//! - [`validate`] — declarative validation against the v1 contract.
//! - [`adapters`] — typed wrappers over the four v1 source kinds
//!   (`git`, `raw_url`, `pypi`, `docker`); pure logic only — actual
//!   network IO is the consumer's concern.
//! - [`shape`] — conversion from a manifest into the `registry.json`
//!   entry shape that ClotoCore consumes today.
//!
//! The crate is intentionally `no_std`-compatible-spirited (no `tokio`,
//! no `reqwest`) so it can be reused from both axum-based ClotoHub.dev
//! and the embedded ClotoCore install path without forcing either to
//! adopt unwanted dependencies.
//!
//! See `project_clotohub_phase_5_design.md` §4-B for the design
//! rationale (mgp-rs workspace consolidation, language-as-strong-axis,
//! direct fallback fairness).
